its my turn to write you one of these little notes

First I have to say I am sorry about yesterday, I should have never written that it was completely undeserved.

More importantly, sorry for being such a complete asshole at times (this is long overdue). Somehow it took the last couple of months for me to realize how badly I treated you, especially during IAP. For you to still be my close friend, I can't really say how much I appreciate it, thank you for being so cool. 

Part of why I wanted to talk to you the other night is because of how dreadful Fridays have been this semester.Besides the whole social chair fail, it has been really hard for me to see you with someone else. I still have the same feelings for you, but obviously the situation is what it is and I am stuck in a weird helplessness. Its kinda why I keep disappearing early when we go out, at a certain point I just can't handle it. Its been building and building for a while now, and yesterday was basically my worst nigthmare, and I reacted poorly. I realize this is just an issue that I have to deal with and if I am not as available from now on just realize I still want to be friends, but going out with you guys is really tough for me.

I am truly super happy for you and hope everything keeps going, you guys seriously seem like a perfect pair (I told Dixon that).I have a some other things going on still, but this is really helpful for me to finally get it out in the open. 

thanks for listening to me this time

k bye
